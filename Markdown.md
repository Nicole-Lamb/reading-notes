Markdown

1) What is Markdown?
  Markdown is a quick way to add style to a webpage without the use of traditional code (HTML/CSS).

2) Why do we use Markdown?
  Because it doesn't require a coding skill, anyone can quickly pick this up and use it to make a webpage.

3) What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
  To create a heading, you will use the # symbol before the text and include a space.
  Ec: # Heading

4) How many do you need to create the largest heading? And how many are needed for the smallest heading?
  Heading sizes range between x1 # and x6 #. To make the largest you will use 1 x # (#), and the smallest uses 6 x # (######).
  Ex: # Huge Heading
  Ex: ###### Tiny Heading

5) When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
  You can use either * or _ symbols when making text bold of italicized. To start take the text that you want to make bold, I'll use the example text: Bold and Italicized.
  First to make it bold, wrap that text in double either symbol. Ex: **bold** or __Bold__ 
  Think about where you want to start the bold text. You are stating where you want the bold to start when you put the */_ sybols before the text to be emboldened. 
  Then you are telling it where you want it to stop when placing the */_ symbols after text to be emboldened.
  Second to make italicised text, use either symbol once on each side of text you want to style. Ex: *Italicized* or _Italicized_.
  
  If you put the full example text together it would look like this:
  **Bold** and *Italicized* or  __Bold__ and _Italicized_.
 
  There are many options to doing this. If you want to nestle in an Italicized text inside the bold you could use different symbols as follows:
  **Bold and _Italicized_**
  All the text would be bold and just Italicized would be italicized.

6) How do you create a link with Markdown?
  Take the text you want to hyperlink and wrap in []. 
    Ex: [GitHub]
  Next put the url link next to it in (). 
    Ex: [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  This will create a link that goes to GitHub and will tell the user that by having the words GitHub hyperlinked.

7) What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
+, *, or -.
