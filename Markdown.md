## Q: When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?

A: You can use either * or _ symbols when making text bold of italicized. To start take the text that you want to make bold, wrap text in either symbol `*/_`. Bold use double the symbols, while italicised uses single symbols. Place the symbol(s) in front and back on text you want affected.

    - Ex: **This text is Bold** or __This text is Bold__
    - Ex: *This text is Italicized* or _This text is Italicized_
    
How it appears: 

+ **This text is Bold** or __This text is Bold__

+ *This text is Italicized* or _This text is Italicized_
  
You can use these two in combination as well by using different symbols for each.

How it appears: 

+ **This text is bold and _this text is bold and italicized_!**
