#### Welcome to the Coder's FAQ! Please see below for answers to your most pressing questions to Text Editors and the Terminal.

## Q: What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

Answer: 

1) **Code Completion**
    - This is similar to predictive text that you see in emails and text messges. As you start to type you can press a button 
    (depending on the editor) and it will complete it. If it doesn't know the exact option a drop down will appear for you to choose.
    
2) **Syntax Highlighting**
    - This color codes the different syntax (or set of rules to a language), so that it helps to understand the formatting and 
    not just seeing a garble of code.
    
3) **Extensions** 
    - These allow for even more customization of your text editor with useful tools that can alleviate pain points and provide additional assitance while coding 
    Having a nice amount to choose from provides more flexibility into the coding experience.
    
4) **Themes** 
    - They aren't just to look pretty! They can also help with avoiding eye strain when a dark mode is available. Again, the more features that allow
   flexibility the better.


## Q: What do the following commands do?

Answer:

1) `pwd` = Print Working Directory 
    - This is the terminal's version of You Are Here. It tells you what directory you are currently in.

2) `ls` = list
    - This will list everything in your current directory.
    - Go to the directory you want to inspect and enter ls.

3) `cd` = Change Directory
    - This allows you to move to different directories. 
    - To do this write cd <directory> Replace what is between <> with the directory you want to change to.

4) `mkdir` = Make Directory
    - Used to create new folders
    - To do this write mkdir <FolderName> Replace what is between <> with the directory you want to create.

5) `touch` = Create File
    - Used to create new files. Don't forget to add the file extensions (ex: .txt, .doc, .pdf etc)
    
## Q: Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

Answer: 

1) `cd projects`
    - This is changing the directory (cd) to the projects folder.

2) `mkdir new-project`
    - This is making a new directory (mkdir) that is named new-project.

3) `touch new-project/newfile.md`
    - This is making (touch) a new file (newfile.md) in the folder new-project.

4) `cd ..`
    - This is changing directories by going back to the previous folder.
    - Changes with x1 . stays in the same directory, x2 .. goes back one.

5) `ls projects/new-project`
    - This is listing (ls) everything in the folder new-project by moving/changing directories through the path projects/new-project.
