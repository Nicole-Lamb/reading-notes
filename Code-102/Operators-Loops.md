# Operators and Loops

## Welcome Back to the Operators and Loops FAQ

Please see below for answers to your most pressing questions!

### Q: What is an expression in JavaScript?

A: is when you use an operator (such as + or -) that when calculated will result in a value.

`Ex: x = 7 + 4;`

### Q: Why would we use a loop in our code?

A: When you want to repeat something over and over until you get a desired result, you would use a loop.

Ex: You want to count to 10 and stop when you've reached that number. You would use a loop.

### Q: When does a for loop stop executing?

A: When it reaches the stopping point the programmer has put in place. If there isn't anything in place, this results in an infinite loop. It's like a song that doesn't end. It just goes on and on my friend.

### Q: How many times will a while loop execute?

A: Until it is coded to stop. If it isn't coded, it ain't stopping!
