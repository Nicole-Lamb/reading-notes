# Programming with JavaScript

## Welcome Back to the Javascript FAQ

Please see below for answers to your most pressing questions!

### Q What is control flow?

A: [The Control flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow) is the order in which a computer executes statements within a script. The flow starts at the first line through the last unless something else changes that flow, such as conditionals or loops.

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### Q: What is a JavaScript function?

A: A [JavaScript function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp) is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it) and stops executing when it reaches a return statement, and often compute a return value.

### Q: What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

A: The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

### Q: What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

A: Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

- Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
- Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
