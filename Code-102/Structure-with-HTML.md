How to make your wireframe good: Three key principles

1. **Clarity**
    - What is the site page?
    - What can user can do there?
    - Does this satisfies the users needs?

2. **Confidence**
    - Is there ease of navigation through your site?
    - Are there clear calls-to-action?
    - Are you increasing user confidence?

3. **Simplicity**
    - Is there too much information, copy, or links?
    - Is this detrimental or productive in achieving the user's goals?
    - Is it constructed in an intuitive and natural way?

#### [*Mozilla HTML Basics*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

Notes taken directly from the site:

`<html></html>` — the `<html>` element. Sets the language. Also known as the root element.

`<head></head>` — the `<head>` element. A container that sets all the info not shown on the page: Keywords, Page descriptions, CSS style, etc.

`<meta charset="utf-8">` — includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">` — the viewpoint element renders at the width of the viewpoint so on mobile devices, the site won't get shrunk down.

`<title></title>` — the `<title>` element. This is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.

`<body></body>` — the `<body>` element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users

#### [*Semantics*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)

Notes taken directly from the site:

Use proper HTML Semantics to reap the most benefits, which incllude:

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)

- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page

- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes

- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated

- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
