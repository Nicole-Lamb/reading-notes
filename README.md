# Welcome to my **Reading Notes**

## About Me

**My name is Nicole Lamb. I am based out of Seattle, WA.** :us:

Check out my portfolio [_here_](https://github.com/Nicole-Lamb).

- I grew up in the South and NorthEast before falling in love with the NorthWest.
- I'm a comic and video game nerd and worked in comic retail for almost a decade.
- I began to learn coding through self-study and mentorship from a friend of mine from 2020-2022.
- In 2023, I'm taking Code 102 through Code Fellows Self-Paced program to refresh on skills I have and build where I have gaps.

## Purpose of this Website

This site is used to take Code 102. I'll be using Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript here. See the Table of Contents below to check out my pages!
