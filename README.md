# Welcome to my **Reading Notes**!

#### **My name is Nicole Lamb. I am based out of Seattle, WA. :us:** 
Check out my portfolio [_here_](https://github.com/Nicole-Lamb).

### About Me
- I grew up in the South and NorthEast before falling in love with the NorthWest.
- I'm a comic and video game nerd and worked in comic retail for almost a decade.
- I began to learn how to code through self-study and mentorship from a friend of mine from 2020-2022. 
- I am taking Code 102 through Code Fellows Self-Paced program to refresh on skills I have and build where I have gaps. 
- This is my first time using Markdown. I have noticed the similarity to the syntax Trello uses. As it turns out, they are using a modified version of Markdown!

#### My objective in these notes are the following:

- [x]  Share more about myself so you can get to know me.
- [x]  To use 5 different features of Markdown on this page.
- [x]  To explain and remind myself about Growth Mindset.
- [x]  Share my progress with others.

### Growth Mindset
1. What is Growth Mindset?
   - It is an empowering perspective that allows you to be open to learning and achieving more.
   - Instead of thinking about your limitations and having that stop you, think about the possibilities of what could be and let that drive you.

2. What are 3 reminders to help stay in a growth mindset?
   - YET - Use the word "yet" when speaking about something I don't know. Ex: "I don't understand Javascript for loops... yet."
   - BE PRESENT - When I get stuck, am being hard on myself, or want to quit - this is a time to stop and realize I am in a fixed mindset.
   - OPPORTUNITY - When there is something I don't know, remember this is an opportunity for growth, not a weakness or lack of intelligence.
