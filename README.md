### About Me
- I grew up in the South and NorthEast before falling in love with the NorthWest.
- I'm a comic and video game nerd and worked in comic retail for almost a decade.
- I began to learn how to code through self-study and mentorship from a friend of mine from 2020-2022. 
- I am taking Code 102 through Code Fellows Self-Paced program to refresh on skills I have and build where I have gaps.
