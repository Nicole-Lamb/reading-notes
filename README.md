#Welcome to my **Reading Notes**!

####**My name is __Nicole Lamb__. I am based out of Seattle, WA, USA.** !(/flag-usa-solid-black.svg) :us:
Check out my portfolio [here](https://github.com/Nicole-Lamb).

###About Me
- I grew up in the south and northeast before falling in love with the northwest.
- I'm a comic and video gagme nerd.
- I began to learn how to code through self-study and mentorship from a friend of mine from 2020-2022. 
- I am taking Code 102 through Code Fellows Self-Paced program to refresh on skills I have and build where I have gaps. 
- This is my first time using Markdown. However, I noticed it to be very similar to the syntax Trello uses, because as it turns out that, they are using a modified version of Markdown!

My objective in these notes are the following:
[x] - To learn Markdown
[x] - To use 5 different features of Markdown
[x] - To explain Growth Mindset
[x] - Share my progress with others

###Growth Mindset
- What is Growth Mindset?
It is an empowering perspective that allows you to learn and achieve more.  
Instead of thinking you can only do x, y, or z, think about adding to that with, and I haven't learned a, b, or c... yet! 
This is an example of growth mindset.

- What are 3 reminders to help stay in a growth mindset?
1. YET - Use the word "yet" when speaking about something I don't know. Ex: "I don't understand Javascript for loops... yet."
2. BE PRESENT - When I get stuck, am being hard on myself, or want to quit - this is a time to stop and realize I am in a fixed mindset.
3. OPPORTUNITY - When there is something I don't know, remember this is an opportunity for growth, not a weakness or lack of intelligence.
