#### My objective in these notes are the following:

- [x]  To use 5 different features of Markdown on this page.
- [x]  To explain and remind myself about Growth Mindset.
- [x]  Share my progress with others.

### Growth Mindset
1. What is Growth Mindset?
   - It is an empowering perspective that allows you to be open to learning and achieving more.
   - Instead of thinking about your limitations and having that stop you, think about the possibilities of what could be and let that drive you.

2. What are 3 reminders to help stay in a growth mindset?
   - YET - Use the word "yet" when speaking about something I don't know. Ex: "I don't understand Javascript for loops... yet."
   - BE PRESENT - When I get stuck, am being hard on myself, or want to quit - this is a time to stop and realize I am in a fixed mindset.
   - OPPORTUNITY - When there is something I don't know, remember this is an opportunity for growth, not a weakness or lack of intelligence.
